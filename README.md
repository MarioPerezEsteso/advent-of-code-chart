# Advent of Code Charts

This is a project that displays a chart (for now) for a private leaderboard for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

This project has been deployed to a GitHub page: [https://marioperezesteso.github.io/advent-of-code-charts/](https://marioperezesteso.github.io/advent-of-code-charts/).

The only chart that exists for now counts the points received per each day and the position of each member in the leaderboard.

# Developing

```shell
yarn install
```

Start application:

```shell
